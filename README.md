Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques in Dravidian Languages

This project is designed to detect fake news in Dravidian languages (Malayalam) using simple Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. The project addresses the increasing concern of misinformation and aims to build models that can accurately classify news articles as real or fake.

Project Stages
1. Text Preprocessing
Tokenization: Splitting text into smaller units called tokens (words, characters, or subwords).
Stop Word Removal: Eliminating common words that carry little meaning.
Stemming & Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.
2. Text Encoding
BERT Encoding:
BERT is a transformer-based model that provides context-aware word embeddings.
Each word in a sentence is represented by a dense vector that captures its meaning, considering the words around it.
BERT helps the model to understand the nuances of language in Dravidian texts, making it more accurate in distinguishing fake news from real news.
4. Classification
Machine Learning Algorithms:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Deep Learning Algorithms:
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)
5. Model Evaluation
Confusion Matrix: Analyzes the performance of classification algorithms.

Results
The project compares several ML and DL models, with Bi-LSTM and BERT encoding achieving the best results for fake news detection.
